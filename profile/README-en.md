# Monga - Technology and Development

*Note: Monga is a fictional company that operates in the technology and development industry, whose main focus is to provide case study models for development labs, from infrastructure to production application. One of the main advantages of working with a visual identity for case study is the possibility to simulate real scenarios, without the concerns of clients, deadlines or budgets. This allows the team to have more freedom to experiment and test different solutions, which can result in more innovative and efficient solutions. Thank you!*
